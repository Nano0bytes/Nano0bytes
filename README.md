- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nano0bytes
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding/programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS/HTML>Flexbox>Git commands
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on working together with a team wether it's through employment or learning processes
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord> Nano_bytes_
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- I currently work in the food/beveage hospitality as a Line Cook, have been for 12+ years. I wish I had sooner found the desire to learn coding many years ago, but better late than never.
- My goal is go through the self taught route of coding/programming so I may learn enough to break free from my Line Cook position and find myself in remote work/learning.
- I full well know that I can't achieve a certain amount of learning, as in this line of work, everybody is learning something new everyday. that excites me.
